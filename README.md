# Alert Triage Workflow – Product Management Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Product Management Trainee assignment at AccuKnox.
The objective of this assignment is to design a simple and effective alert triage workflow
that helps security engineers investigate and resolve cloud security alerts efficiently
in a Zero Trust cloud-native environment.

---

## Problem Statement

Cloud-native platforms generate a large number of security alerts across runtime, network,
identity and configuration layers. Security engineers are required to continuously monitor
these alerts and take timely action to prevent potential security incidents.

However, alerts often lack sufficient context and prioritization, leading to alert fatigue,
delayed response, and difficulty in identifying critical threats.
A simple and structured alert triage workflow is required to help security engineers quickly
understand alerts, investigate them efficiently, and resolve them with confidence.

**Objective:**  
Design a clear and intuitive alert triage workflow that enables faster investigation,
better prioritization, and effective resolution of cloud security alerts in a Zero Trust environment.

## User Persona

**Role:** Security Engineer / SOC Analyst  
**Experience:** 2–6 years  
**Environment:** Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)

### Responsibilities
- Monitor cloud security alerts
- Investigate suspicious activities
- Identify false positives
- Remediate genuine security threats

### Pain Points
- High volume of alerts
- Lack of clear severity and context
- Manual investigation across multiple tools
- Difficulty prioritizing alerts

### Goals
- Quickly identify high-risk alerts
- Reduce investigation time
- Resolve alerts efficiently
- Maintain strong security posture

## Alert Triage Workflow

### Alert Lifecycle Overview
1. A security alert is generated by the platform  
2. The alert appears in a centralized alert list  
3. The security engineer reviews alert severity and metadata  
4. The engineer opens the alert to investigate detailed context  
5. Based on findings, appropriate action is taken  
6. The alert is resolved and closed with proper documentation  

This workflow ensures alerts are handled consistently while reducing noise and confusion.

## Wireframes Overview

### Screen 1: Alert List (Triage Entry Point)
**Purpose:**  
Provide a high-level view of all active alerts and help engineers prioritize effectively.

**Key Elements:**
- Alert name and type  
- Severity level (Critical / High / Medium / Low)  
- Affected resource (Pod, Container, VM, IAM role)  
- Timestamp  
- Status (Open / Resolved)  
- Filters (severity, cloud account, time range)

---

### Screen 2: Alert Details & Investigation
**Purpose:**  
Provide complete context required to understand and investigate an alert.

**Key Elements:**
- Alert summary  
- Severity and risk score  
- Affected resource details  
- Timeline of events  
- Possible cause or policy violation

---

### Screen 3: Resolution & Action
**Purpose:**  
Enable quick and confident resolution of alerts.

**Key Elements:**
- Resolution options (Resolve, Mark False Positive, Mitigate)  
- Notes/comments section  
- Status update  
- Confirmation of action taken
